# Car-Racer-Vanilla-JS

Here is a Car Racer Game in Vanilla JavaScript made by shivamjain1<br/><br/>

It's a single Player Game built only using html, css and vanilla JS. <br/><br/>

With the help of Dr Mitch Bryson, from the University of Sydney, I have made a few modifications to the javascript code to be able to play with a potentiometer (as the car wheel) and a joystick (to go up and down the road) connected to an arduino board. <br/><br/>

Hope you like it! <br/><br/>
